    <h1>Yepip Vulpine</h1>
    <p>There is nothing more beautiful then the world around us. Pristine life
       exists just a mile off the path we so often walk. I've always wanted to
       capture it as it evolves and thrives.</p>
    <p>I'm a double major from BYU in Biology and Photography. I've set my sights
       on studying and documenting the world around us as both a way to bring
        nature back into the home and help preserve the worlds I explore. As part
         of that I always give back part of my revenue to support the ongoing
         effort to save the world around us.</p>
    <p>My work often pushes me out into the wild where I spend weeks living out
      of tents and sleeping under the stars. It's extremely hard work hiking miles
       to the tops of cliffs, balancing on the edge of waterfalls, and holding
       still for hours. Sitting hour 2 days waiting for a fox and her kits to come
       out of a den produced my favorite photo yet. A photo speaks a thousand words, but
       making one with a story worth telling takes just as many hours. </p>
